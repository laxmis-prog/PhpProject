# PhpProject

PhpProject is a wellness tracking application that allows users to monitor their well-being by logging customizable wellness entries. Developed independently to deepen my understanding of web development, this project showcases my ability to implement user authentication and data management using various web technologies.

## Project Overview

The application enables users to register and log in securely. Once authenticated, users can enter their wellness data, which is stored in a MySQL database. This project illustrates my grasp of both client-side and server-side programming, providing a comprehensive experience in full-stack development.

## Features
